# Welcome to GraphStorage 

GraphStorage is a Java library for storing large-scale property graphs in secondary memory (HDD/SSD). It is built on top of RocksDB to provide a fast, persistent, and efficient storage layer.

While this library was developed as a core component for the PathDB graph database engine, it is designed as a standalone module that can be integrated into any Java project requiring persistent graph data structures.


## Features

- Persistent Storage: Leverages RocksDB for a fast and durable key-value store, optimized for modern SSDs.

- Bulk Ingestion: Optimized methods for loading large `.pgdf` datasets quickly.

- Lazy Iteration: All collection-based queries (getNodeIterator, getNeighbours, etc.) return AutoCloseableIterables, ensuring low memory overhead by streaming data directly from disk.

- Query API: Provides methods for single-entity lookups (by ID), property-based searches, and neighbor retrieval.

- Schema & Metadata: Includes helpers to query graph-wide metadata (e.g., node/edge counts) and infer the graph's structure.
